# DT-Screening-Todo-List
Creating a simple todo-list using vanila js 

## 📝 Project Overview  
This is a simple **To-Do List** web application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It allows users to:  
✅ Add new tasks  
✅ Mark tasks as completed  
✅ Delete tasks  
✅ Use the "Enter" key to add tasks  

The project was developed in **vanilla JavaScript**, following the requirements provided. 

## 🚀 How I Tackled the Task  
1. **Setup the Basic Structure**  
   - Created `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `vanilla.js`  
   - Linked the JavaScript and CSS files properly

2. **Implemented Core Features**  
   - Added event listeners for adding tasks via the button & Enter key  
   - Used JavaScript to manipulate the DOM for adding, marking, and deleting tasks  

3. **Styled the To-Do List**  
   - Ensured the design is **responsive**  
   - Used a **hover effect** for the delete button  

4. **Final Testing & Debugging**  
   - Fixed event listener issues  
   - Ensured compatibility across different screen sizes  


## ⏳ Time Management & Challenges  
I aimed to complete the task in **2 hours**, and here’s how it went:  
✅ **Completed:** Adding, marking, and deleting tasks  
⚠ **Challenges:**
